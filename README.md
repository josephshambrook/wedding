# Joseph and Louise
This is a website and webapp I created for our wedding in 2017. The app is an RSVP system for our guests to be able to select if they're attending and extra information we require.

This was my first project working with Python and Django, meaning I was mostly learning as I was writing. People are welcome to use the code as they wish, but beware that there are things that I would change and reorganise.
